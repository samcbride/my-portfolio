        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Shona McBride and I'm originally from Vancouver, Canada. I moved to Manchester with my boyfriend almost one year ago after spending a year in Barcelona.
            My parents live in the east of Canada and I have two sisters and two nieces all of whom lived in Barcelona until earlier this year when one of my sisters recently moved to the Netherlands. 
            I grew up in North Vancouver, a suburb of Vancouver, which is close to the mountains. I originally trained as a nurse in Vancouver and worked in the profession for four years before deciding to move to Barcelona to be closer to family for a while.</p>
        <p>Some of the hobbies I enjoy are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bouldering</li>
          <li>Rowing</li>
          <li>Hiking</li>
          <li>Being outdoors</li>
          <li>Reading</li>
          <li>Occasionally sewing clothes and then immediately hating them for some reason..</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I decided to try a web development bootcamp after being introduced to the world of coding through my boyfriend. I'd never thought I could do anything involving tech, but after trying out some free online resources I found I really quite liked it. I'm excited for all the learning that's coming up and to look back on the progress I've made at the end.</p>
        <p>Some quick trivia before you go:<br><br>What is one of the things I miss most about Vancouver?</p>
