            <p>Hello! My name is Shona and I currently live in Manchester though I am originally from Canada. I grew up in North Vancouver, a suburb of Vancouver near the mountains. 
               I moved to Manchester with my boyfriend one year ago after spending a year in Barcelona.<br><br>
               I originally trained as a nurse in Vancouver and worked in the profession for four years before moving to Barcelona to be closer to family for a while. 
               I have two sisters, both of whom lived in Barcelona (hence the move there), though one recently relocated to the Netherlands. 
               I also have two lovely nieces in Barcelona who I try to see as often as I can. My parents live in the east of Canada. We're a spread-out bunch now, but we do enjoy it when we can all get together.<br><br>
               Some hobbies I enjoy are bouldering, rowing, hiking, being outdoors, reading, and occasionally sewing clothes and then immediately hating them for some reason.. 
               I like to try new things and experiences and to be challenged, which is why I decided to try a web development bootcamp. 
               I was originally introduced to the world of coding through my boyfriend. I'd never thought I could do anything involving tech, but after trying out some free online resources I found I really quite liked it. 
               I'm excited for all the learning that's coming up and to look back on the progress I've made at the end.</p>
