      <p class="item2">
        Hello! My name is Shona and I currently live in Manchester though I am
        originally from Canada. I grew up in North Vancouver, a suburb of
        Vancouver near the mountains. I moved to Manchester with my boyfriend
        one year ago after spending a year in Barcelona.<br /><br />
        I originally trained as a nurse in Vancouver and worked in the
        profession for four years before moving to Barcelona to be closer to
        family for a while. I have two sisters, both of whom lived in Barcelona
        (hence the move there), though one recently relocated to the
        Netherlands. I also have two lovely nieces in Barcelona who I try to see
        as often as I can. My parents live in the east of Canada. We're a
        spread-out bunch now, but we do enjoy it when we can all get
        together.<br /><br />
        Some hobbies I enjoy are bouldering, rowing, hiking, being outdoors,
        reading, and occasionally sewing clothes and then immediately hating
        them for some reason.. I like to try new things and experiences and to
        be challenged, which is why I decided to try a web development bootcamp.
        I was originally introduced to the world of coding through my boyfriend.
        I'd never thought I could do anything involving tech, but after trying
        out some free online resources I found I really quite liked it. I'm
        excited for all the learning that's coming up and to look back on the
        progress I've made at the end.
